## User Story
On average, 150 million individuals per year attend professional sporting events. During a global pandemic, spectator attendance deminishes to almost 0. We have developed an app that brings people together and creates an environment to compete against each other.

``` 
AS an individual, I enjoy spending time with my friends by going to sporting events or watching games and events on TV.  
I WANT to be able to connect, debate, and converse over outcomes of games/events. 
AND I want to be able to debate a variety of different events.
SO I can feel connected to a group of individuals that have the same interest as me, anywhere anytime.

## Future Developments

### Video Capabilites 

**Allow users to watch games on the app directly**

Allowing users to watch the game and comment in one place would make for a more streamlined experience. TA members could watch live games and make comments and predictions based on what is happening in real time.

### Previous Scores and Comments

**Display previous scores and comments for teams that have competed before**

Displaying previous official win/loss record, comments and user input on who was projected to win, would help the user formulate a clearer decision on who they believe the winner will be. Looking at previous content might strength or weaken their prediction. 

### User Ranking System

**This feature would allow members to gain points for how active they are on Together Against**

Allow members to gain points and ranking based on how many projections they get correct and how active they are on Together Against
