## User Story
On average, 150 million individuals per year attend professional sporting events. During a global pandemic, spectator attendance deminishes to almost 0. We have developed an app that brings people together and creates an environment to compete against each other.

``` 
AS an individual, I enjoy spending time with my friends by going to sporting events or watching games and events on TV.  
I WANT to be able to connect, debate, and converse over outcomes of games/events. 
AND I want to be able to debate a variety of different events.
SO I can feel connected to a group of individuals that have the same interest as me, anywhere anytime.

## Future Developments

### Video Capabilites 

**Allow users to watch games on the app directly**

Allowing users to watch the game and comment in one place would make for a more streamlined experience. TA members could watch live games and make comments and predictions based on what is happening in real time.

### Previous Scores and Comments

**Display previous scores and comments for teams that have competed before**

Displaying previous official win/loss record, comments and user input on who was projected to win, would help the user formulate a clearer decision on who they believe the winner will be. Looking at previous content might strength or weaken their prediction. 

### User Ranking System

**This feature would allow members to gain points for how active they are on Together Against**

Allow members to gain points and ranking based on how many projections they get correct and how active they are on Together Against

### Event Control
**Event management would allow for a better user experience**

There are a number of additional functionalities that would make for a better user experience. Eventually, the events commenting and voting features would close after the event is finished. This would allow members to see which opponent won...without people knowing the outcome. Also, creating a search bar would allow members to quickly find an event. 

### Top Events and Highlights
**Show the people what they want to see**

Everyone loves highlights and top events when to comes to compeititons. We would like to give our members that experience. Adding a "Top Events" page would allow members to see where others are commenting and voting the most at that time. Additionally, allowing members to view and vote on top highlights throughout would add more interaction with the app.
